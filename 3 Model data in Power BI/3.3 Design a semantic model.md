### Tables ###
General rule of thumb: Keep it simple, fewer tables

Simple table structure
- Simple to navigate, user friendly
- Has merged or appended table
- Relationship between tables that make sense

#### Configure semantic model and build relationship between table ####

Go to "Manage Relationship" and configure

#### Configure table and column properties #### 

Go to **Model** view
You can edit name description, hide/show/add columns. Change data type and format date

#### Create a date table ####

Can be created through DAX and Power Query or Source data

#### Work with dimesions ####

Hierachies can be used to find or "level" details in dimension table
Like Dates: Year/Quarter/Month/Year

Sub Category: Fruits -> Orange bla bla bla Veggies -> tomatoes bla bla bla
Parent Child Category: Parent/Child jobs in old job

#### Define data granularity #### 
- How detailed the data is needed
- See what is needed (sometimes for eg, if month is allk we need, can get rid of the day if it is irrelevent)

#### Work with relationships ####
Many to one
One to Many
One to One
Many to Many

Pretty self explanatory for myself, Many to Many is much more complicated and not recommended

Cross filter directions
Single: Kinda like left join. the one with "Many" is filtered if the relationship is one to many or many to one.

Bi Oriental -> Filtered both ways

#### Challenges in modelling ####
Circular relationships may occur
