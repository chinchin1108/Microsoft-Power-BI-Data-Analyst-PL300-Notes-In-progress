### Describe Power BI Model Fundamentals ### 

**Data Model**: A query-able semantic model/data resource
**Power BI Dataset**: Power BI Artifact that is a source of data for visualisation
**Analytic Query**: DAX etc. Filter Group Summarize
**Tabular Model**: A Power BI Tabular Model consists of one or more tables
**Star Schema**: Fact table and many dim tables relationship. We know what it is.
**Table Storage Mode (Main Topic for this page)**: Import, DirectQuery (DQ), Dual

### Import Models ###

An import model comprises tables that have their data stored/cached in Power BI
As the data is cached, it needs to be refreshed from the source data.

#### Benefits of Import ####
Most Flexible
- Supports all PBI Data source types (eg database, files, feeds, webpages etc)
- Can integrate from source data (webpage api etc)
- Supports ALL Power Query and DAX functionality (essentially full control)
- Supports calculated tables
- Best query performance as data is cached

#### Limitations of Import ####
Model Size: PBI has 1GB (or 10GB for Premium) size limite per dataset. Import can be large since it is stored on PBI
Data must be periodically refreshed.

### DirectQuery (DQ) Models ###

Data is queried directly from the data source

#### Benefits of DQ ####
- Allows you to modelo large and fast changing data sources
- Useful when source data enforces RLS, so no need to replicate it on PBI
- Will not breach policy if data cannot exit to other databases

#### Limitations of DQ ####
- Not all data sources are supported
- Not all Power Query functions are usable
- Analytic Query Performance are slow and can impact source system performance

#### Miltigating DQ Performance ####
Data source optimisations such as:
- Create index or materialised views
- Add user-defined aggregate tables

### Composite model (Dual) ###
A hybrid of both models above
So... some are import some are DQ

#### Benefits of composite model ####
