## Restrict access to Power BI ##
As data modelers -> We set up roles -> Each roles have its own rules.

## Define rules ##
### Static rules ###

Hard coded filters. 
Eg
'Region'[Region] = "Midwest"

### Dynamic rules ###
Uses specific DAX functions to return environmental values instead of constraints.

USERNAME or USERPRINCIPALNAME -> Return Power BI authenticated user as text value
CUSTOMDATA -> Returns the CustomData property passed in the connection string. 

### Validate roles ###
View as can let you see the report under various roles

## Restrict access to Power BI model ##
OLS -> Object level security -> Restrict access to specific tables and columns etc (sensitive infos)
Can be added via XML for Analysis endpoint (XMLA)

### Considerations ###
An error will pop up if the user doesnt show up

### Restrictions ###
You cannot mix OLS and RLS in one role, so have to create seperate roles for each type
