## Introduction ##
Performance optimisation is a way to improve semantic model's efficiency.

## Review performance of measures, relationships, and visuals ##
Poor performance of reports -> Negative user experience.

## Identify report performance bottlenecks ##

### Analyze Performance ###

**Performance analyzer** in Power BI Desktop can be used to identify performance issue and troubleshooting.
Ensure to clear both Visual and Data engine cache

Review the results -> Check the Duration it takes.
The log displays information for the following:
- DAX Query
- Visual display
- Other

### Resolve issues and optimize performance ###

**Visuals**: consider using fewer visuals, removing unnecessary ones
**DAX Query**: General rule of thumb is when a DAX query takes more than 120 ms to run, use a less intensive function such as replacing FILTER with KEEPFILTER.
**Semantic Model**: Maybe relations, columns or metadata may have caused the long time
**Metadata**: 
- Remove unnecessary columns, rowa
- Check Column details,
- Change uncommon or unhelpful query names
**Autodate time feature**
  - Disabling can lower the size of the semantic model.
  - File -> Option and settings -> Options

  ## Use variables to improve performance and troubleshooting
  Variables has a lot of advantages, such as
  - Improved performance: Variables increase efficiency it remove the need for Power BI to evaluate the same expression multiple times
  - Improved readability: Makes it easier to read and understand formula
  - Simplified debugging: And thus this
  - Reduced complexity:
 
  It is the VAR function very commonly used in DAX
