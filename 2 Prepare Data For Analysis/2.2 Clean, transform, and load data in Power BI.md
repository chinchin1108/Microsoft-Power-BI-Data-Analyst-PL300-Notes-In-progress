## Shape the initial data ##

Power Query can be used to transform imported data.
To start, use cases as been below:
1. Click **Transform Data** under **Home Tab**
Note: All steps in Power Query is recorded, and you can go back to make changes (such as filter rows etc), so each time a data source is changed, the subsequent steps will be applied to the data
2. Identify Column Headers and names, and then promote headers if needed (when the data in the first row is the header)
3. Rename columns (Spelling error etc)
4. Remove blank/unnecessary rows and columns
5. Pivot/Unpivot tables. 
Eg use cases, 
For unpivot, if there is a year column contains month as shown below, it is easier to distinguish the data by making the year a column and then each column has the month.
