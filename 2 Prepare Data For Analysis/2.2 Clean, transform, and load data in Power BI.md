## Shape the initial data ##

Power Query can be used to transform imported data.
To start, use cases as been below:
1. Click **Transform Data** under **Home Tab**
Note: All steps in Power Query is recorded, and you can go back to make changes (such as filter rows etc), so each time a data source is changed, the subsequent steps will be applied to the data
2. Identify Column Headers and names, and then promote headers if needed (when the data in the first row is the header)
3. Rename columns (Spelling error etc)
4. Remove blank/unnecessary rows and columns
5. Pivot/Unpivot tables. 
Eg use cases, 
For unpivot, if there is a year column contains month as shown below, it is easier to distinguish the data by making the year a column and then each column has the month.

## Simplify the data structure ##
This section is on renaming the table names (or queries) for readability

### Rename a query ###
In case where a query name is unclear, renaming will help in identifying in the future for root cause analysis etc..
Right click the query -> **Rename** -> Edit whatever then click **Enter**

### Replace a value ### 
Example case, spelling errors (Eg Desember instead of December)
You can replace by: **Transform** tab -> **Replace Values** -> Values to find and replace is similar to Find and Replace in SQL editor Excel etc etc

### Replace null value ###
Same as replace value, but Find 'null'. Power BI will know it is null, this is kinda like SQL.

### Remove duplicates ###
Drop down on column name and click **remove duplicates**
If you want to keep unique names.

### Best Practice ###
Recommended to use language that are commonly understood
Give abbreviations 
Keep it simple! No need to use special characters
When replacing always keep in mind on how it will look in the report, primary audience is the most important key

## Evaluate and change column data types ##
When importing data, Power BI automatically scans for the top 1000 rows of data to determine the data type
When incorrect data type occurs, performance issues will arise
### Implications of incorrect data type ###
Such as:
1) Preventing you from creating certain calculations/measures (Eg Power BI treating a column as text when it is date/number)
2) Unable to create a date hierachy because text instead of date

### Change the column data type to the correct one ###
Via Power Query Editor
Go to Power Query editor -> Select the relevant column -> Transform -> Data Type

### Combining multiple tables into a single one ###

#### Appending Queries ####
Pretty much **union all** in SQL
Same number of columns

#### Merge Queries ####
Pretty much **JOINS** in SQL
Have a common id or something and join via left or inner etc joins

### Profile data in Power BI ###
