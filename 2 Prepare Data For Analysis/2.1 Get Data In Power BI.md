# 2.1 Get Data in Power BI #

## Get data from files (eg Excel, csv, txt)  ##

### Importing Data from files ###
- Click **Get Data**
- Select file data to import (Can be Excel, csv, txt)
- Click **Load** to automatically load data/Select **transform data** to launce the Power Query Editor

### Change the source file ###
- Click **Data source settings** -> In the window Select the file and then -> **Change Source** -> Update the **file path** or **Browse**
- If you are changing a file path, make sure that you reconnect to the same file with the same file structure. Any structural changes to a file, such as **deleting** or **renaming columns** in the source file, will **break** the reporting model.

## Get data from relational data sources (Eg SQL Server) ##

### Get data from relational data sources ###
- Click **Get Data** -> **SQL Server**

- Enter your **database server** (Like ClickH, Conint server) and **database** (intxxx, prod etc)
- Enter your username and password for the database: can be Windows, Database credentials, Microsoft Account

### Select data to import ###
- When a database is connected to Power BI Desktop -> **Navigator** window displays the data that is available in your data source
- You can select kinda like how you do from files (by Load or Transform Data w Power Query)

### Import data by writing an SQL Query ###
- After entering server and database -> Select arrow next to **advanced options** to expand and use the SQL statement box to endter SQL query

- Prefably to use view statements

### Change data source setting ###
- Click **transform data** -> **Data Source Settings**
- <img width="529" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94827147/219348784-e8c9d34e-bcc7-4493-a6ac-980952d08479.png">
- Cick **change source** and change whichever settings to suit your needs

## Get data from NoSQL database ##

### Connect to a NoSQL database (Azure Cosmos DB)
- click **Get Data** ->  **More** -> **Azure** Category -> **Azure Cosmos DB** -> **Connect**
- On the **Preview Connector** -> **Continue** -> Enter database credentials

### Import a JSON file ###
- JSON files have to be extracted and normalised 
- Gotta convert to a file column etc. Know how json file looks like so no need to go in too detailed
- _Subject to change nearing the exam_

## Get data from online services ##

Collect data from other applications such as SharePoint, OneDrive, Dynamics 365, Google Analytics etc

### Connect to data in an application ###

Using Sharepoint in this example
- Click **Get Data** -> **Online Service** Category -> **Sharepoint Online List**
- -> Connect -> asked for sharepoint url
- Load the data

## Select a storage mode ##
There may be security requirements around the data that make it impossible to directly import a copy
Or too large.

3 different types of storage modes to choose from

### Import ###
- Allows you to create a local Power BI copy of your datasets from your data source

### DirectQuery ###
- Useful when you don't want to save local copies of your data because your data won't be cached
- Instead, you can query the specific tables that you'll need by using native Power BI queries, and the required data will be retrieved from the underlying data source
- Essentially -> Creating a direct connection to the data source
- Ensures that you are viewing the most up to date data
- Suitable for lagre dataset as it does not slow down performance


### Dual (Composite Mode) ###
-  identify some data to be directly imported and other data that must be queried
-  Most efficient form of data retrieval

## Get data from Azure Analysis Services ##
- **Get data** -> **Analysuis Services** -> Enter **server address** and **Database**
- Select either **Import** or **Connect live**

## Fix performance issues ##

### Optimising performance in Power Query ###

### Query folding ###
- The process by which the transformations and edits that you make in Power Query Editor are simultaneously tracked as native queries, or simple Select SQL statements, while you're actively making transformations
- It is to ensure that these transformations can take place in the original data source server and don't use too much Power BI computing resource/power

Benefits of query folding: 
1.  More efficiency in data refreshes and incremental refreshes: Cos Power BI dont have to run through each transformation locally
2.  Automatic compatibility with DirectQuery and Dual storage modes: All DirectQuery and Dual storage mode data sources must have the back-end server processing abilities to create a direct connection, which means that query folding is an automatic capability that you can use. If all transformations can be reduced to a single Select statement, then query folding can occur.

Native queries aren't possible for the following transformations:
- Adding an index column
- Merging and appending columns of different tables with two different sources
- Changing the data type of a column

### Query diagnostics ###
Used to determine which party of extracing loading bla bla bla on data is taking a long time to do

To access query diagnostics:
**Tools** in Home ribbon -> **Start Diagnostics** in the Session Diagnostics -> **Stop Diagnostics** when done
- **Diagnose step** shows you the length of time it takes to run that step

### Other techniques to optimize performance ###
- Process as much data as possible in the original data source
- Use native SQL Query -> better than pulling from stored procedures or common table expressions (With cte as bla bla bla)
- Separate date and time, if bound together

## Resolve data import errors ##

While importing data into Power Bi, you may encounter errors resulting from footers such as:
<ul>
  <li>Power BI Imports from numerous data sources</li>
  <li>Each data sources might have dozeds (or even hundreds) of different error messages</li>
  <li>Other components can cause errors, such as hard drives, networks, software services and Operating Systers</li>
  <li>Data often cannot comply with any specific schema</li>
</ul>

Examples of errors below

### Query Timeout Expired ###

- Relational Source systems -> A lot of people may be using the same database at the same tyime
- Administrators may put a limit to prevent user to use up all the hardware resources

### Power BI Query Error Timeout expired ###
- Means you have pulled too much data according to your organisation's policies
- Administrators did this to avoid slowing down application(s)
- Resolve by pulling less data (fewer columns or rows), if all of them are needed, pull bit by bit and merge in Power Query.

### We couldn't find any data formatted as a table ###
This error occurs when importing data from Microsoft Excel.
Can be resolved by the following steps:
<ol>
  <li>Open your Excel workbook, highlight the data you want to import</li>
  <li>Ctr + T, First row will likely be your column header</li>
  <li>Validate the data then import</li>
</ol>

### Couldn't find file error ###

- Caused by changing file locations
  OR
- Permission file

If first reason, resolve by:
1. Open Power Query through **Transform Data**
2. Highlight the query that is causing the error
3. On the left, under **Query Settings**, select the gear icon next to the Source.

4. Change the file location to the new location

### Data type error ###
Familiar with this, SQL just use CAST function etc etc
