# 2.1 Get Data in Power BI #

## Get data from files (eg Excel, csv, txt)  ##

### Importing Data from files ###
- Click **Get Data**
- Select file data to import (Can be Excel, csv, txt)
- Click **Load** to automatically load data/Select **transform data** to launce the Power Query Editor

### Change the source file ###
- Click **Data source settings** -> In the window Select the file and then -> **Change Source** -> Update the **file path** or **Browse**
- If you are changing a file path, make sure that you reconnect to the same file with the same file structure. Any structural changes to a file, such as **deleting** or **renaming columns** in the source file, will **break** the reporting model.

## Get data from relational data sources (Eg SQL Server) ##

- Enter your **database server** (Like ClickH, Conint server) and **database** (intxxx, prod etc)
- Enter your username and password for the database: can be Windows, Database credentials, Microsoft Account

### Select data to import ###
- When a database is connected to Power BI Desktop -> **Navigator** window displays the data that is available in your data source
- You can select kinda like how you do from files (by Load or Transform Data w Power Query)

### Import data by writing an SQL Query ###
- After entering server and database -> Select arrow next to **advanced options** to expand and use the SQL statement box to endter SQL query

- Prefably to use view statements

### Change data source setting ###
- Click **transform data** -> **Data Source Settings**
- <img width="529" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94827147/219348784-e8c9d34e-bcc7-4493-a6ac-980952d08479.png">
- Cick **change source** and change whichever settings to suit your needs

## Get data from NoSQL database ##

### Connect to a NoSQL database (Azure Cosmos DB)
- click **Get Data** ->  **More** -> **Azure** Category -> **Azure Cosmos DB** -> **Connect**
- On the **Preview Connector** -> **Continue** -> Enter database credentials

### Import a JSON file ###
- JSON files have to be extracted and normalised 
- Gotta convert to a file column etc. Know how json file looks like so no need to go in too detailed
- _Subject to change nearing the exam_

## Get data from online services ##

Collect data from other applications such as SharePoint, OneDrive, Dynamics 365, Google Analytics etc

### Connect to data in an application ###

Using Sharepoint in this example
- Click **Get Data** -> **Online Service** Category -> **Sharepoint Online List**
- -> Connect -> asked for sharepoint url
- Load the data

## Select a storage mode ##
There may be security requirements around the data that make it impossible to directly import a copy
Or too large.

3 different types of storage modes to choose from

### Import ###
- Allows you to create a local Power BI copy of your datasets from your data source

### DirectQuery ###
- Useful when you don't want to save local copies of your data because your data won't be cached
- Instead, you can query the specific tables that you'll need by using native Power BI queries, and the required data will be retrieved from the underlying data source
- Essentially -> Creating a direct connection to the data source
- Ensures that you are viewing the most up to date data
- Suitable for lagre dataset as it does not slow down performance


### Dual (Composite Mode) ###
-  identify some data to be directly imported and other data that must be queried
-  Most efficient form of data retrieval

## Get data from Azure Analysis Services ##
- **Get data** -> **Analysuis Services** -> Enter **server address** and **Database**
- Select either **Import** or **Connect live**

## Fix performance issues ##

### Optimising performance in Power Query ###
