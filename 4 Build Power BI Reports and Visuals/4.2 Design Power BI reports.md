## Design the analytical report layout ##

- Generally top left for most important, this is more on how our eyes work
- Assign neatly, horizontally and vertically alligned
- Ensure it is balanced
- Repetitive visuals can strengthen the information it is trying to convey
- Contrast -> Have different colours to lead consumers to differentiate and look
- Proximity -> Having spaces between visuals helps make it look neatert

## Design visually appealing reports ##
Some things to consider while deciding:
Space
Margins

Object Spacing
Colours (about contrasting colours)

## Report objects ##
Each report contains the following:
**Visuals**: Visualisations from data (Graphs, tables etc)
**Elements**: Objects not from the data (Text boxes etc)

## Select report visuals ##
NOTE: The notes in mlearn looks like it just gives suggestions, while it make sense, make note that in real life it differs for whatever issues you are facing.

### Categorical visuals ###
For data with multiple categories. Normally bar charts are used.

### Time series visuals ###
Line charts are normally used. But, if there are gaps, column charts might be better. Line just doesnt look that good with that straight line declining down thanks to the gap.
Other visualisations that are viable include:
- Stacked column chart
- Area chart
- Line and stacked column chart
- Ribbon chart
  
### Proportional visuals ###
For proportional data, showing % would be ideal (thus 100% stacked charts will be ideal)
Other visuals that may be viable:
- Pie chart
- Funnel chart
- Treemap
- Donut chart

### Numerical visuals ###
Cards. Nuff said. Multi rows cards, again, depending on situation.

### Grid visuals ###
Possibly use matrix visuals, grouping columns can be very helpful and better than table to display information.

### Performance visuals ###
For performance, comparison with target, KPIs
The following visuals would be viable:
- Gauge
- KPI

### Geospatial visuals ###
Filled map vs dotted map

## Select report visuals to suit the report layout ##
Vertical vs Horizontal

## Format and configure visuals ##
At the side of the visual -> go to format
