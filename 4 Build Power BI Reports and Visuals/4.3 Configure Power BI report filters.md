## Adding filters to the report ##

Filtering can occur at 5 different levels of a report

1. Semantic model (RLS)
2. Report
3. Page
4. Visual
5. Measure

**Apply filters to the report structure**: Filter panel at the left, can apply visual to all or variables. Can lock so that consumers can't change it.

**Apply filter with slicers**: Slicer is used to filter other visuals

**Design report with advanced filtering**

- Visual interactions: Cross filters can be introduced, per se a card that has to show the total no matter the slicer's config
- Drillthrough
- Report tooltip
- Bookmark

**Consumption-time filtering**: 
In reading view, the following can be used
- Slicers
- Filters (if not hidden)

To determine applied filters, consumer can use the filter icon to see what is applied in the current visual

## Filters vs Slicers ##
Filters uses less power, but less flexible than slicers.
