# 1.2 Get started building with Power BI #
## Use Power BI ##

The Common Flow of Activities looks like this:
1. Bring data into Power BI Desktop, and create a report.
2. Publish to the Power BI service, where you can create new visualizations or build dashboards.
3. Share dashboards with others, especially people who are on the go.
4. View and interact with shared dashboards and reports in Power BI Mobile apps

## Basic Building blocks of Power BI ##

### Visualisations ###
- Visual representation of data
- Eg chart, a color-coded map, or other interesting things you can create to represent your data visually

- Goal of a visual is to present data in a way that provides context and insights, both of which would probably be difficult to discern from a raw table of numbers or text.

### Datasets ###
- Collection of data that Power BI uses to create its visualizations
- Excel spreadsheet, SQL Database

### Reports ###
- A collection of visualizations that appear together on one or more pages

### Dashboards ###
- A single page report

### Tiles ###
- A single visualization on a dashboard. It's the rectangular box that holds an individual visual. In the following image, you see one tile, which is also surrounded by other tiles.

## Tour and use the Power BI service ##
- An app is a collection of prest, ready-made visuals and reports that are shared with an entire organisation.

### Create out-of-box dashboards with cloud services ###
- Connect data by clicking **Get Data** in the bottom left corner of the home page.
