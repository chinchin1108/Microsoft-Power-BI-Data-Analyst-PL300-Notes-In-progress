# 1.1 Discover Data Analysis #

## Overview of data analysis ##
- Data analysis is the process of identifying, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover meaningful and useful information
- The data is then crafted into a story through reports for analysis to support the critical decision-making process.
- There are 5 core components of data analysis:

    ### Descriptive analytics ###
	- **What** has happened based on historical data. 
	- **DESCRIBE**. 
    - (E.g. generating reports to provide a view of an organization's sales and financial data.)
    ### Diagnostic analytics ###
	- **Why** an event has happened. 
	- **DIAGNOSE**
     - Happens in 3 steps below:
       1) Identify anomalies in the data. These anomalies might be unexpected changes in a metric or a particular market.
       2) Collect data that's related to these anomalies.
       3) Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain these anomalies.
    ### Predictive analytics ###
	- **What** will happen in the **future** 
	- **PREDICT**
    ### Prescriptive analytics ### 
	- **Which** actions to take to achieve a goal or target to make data driven decisions 
	- **PRESCRIBE**
    ### **Cognitive** analytics ###
	- **What might** happen when situation changes. 
	- **Predictive** but takes into account of **other scenarios**.

## Roles in data ##

### Business Analyst ###
- A business analyst is closer to the business and is a specialist in interpreting the data that comes from the visualization. vs data analyst

### Data Analyst ###
- A data analyst enables businesses to maximize the value of their data assets through visualization and reporting tools such as Microsoft Power BI
- Responsible for profiling, cleaning, and transforming data
- Designing and building scalable and effective data models, and enabling and implementing the advanced analytics capabilities into reports for analysis
